Prioritize is a better way to keep track of your TODO list.  It is centered around the ability to quickly drag and drop your TODO list items into the order you want to do them in.  You can create subtasks, due dates, notes, and visually track the progress of your to do list items.  This app will eventually sync with google calendar.
